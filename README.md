# Quantifying the Effect of Natural Selection on the Human Genome using Machine Learning

This project uses convolutional neural networks(CNNs) to quantify the effect of natural selection on genomes. The CNN is trained on data simulated using the MSMS coalescent simulation program. Real data in FASTA format can then be fed into the neural network to make quantitative predictions about the effect of natural selection.
